Q1: Why might we consider using Git? 

Answer: Git is incredibly helpful for collaboration, specifically allowing developers to collaborate on a project simultaneously 
while maintaining a complete history of all changes made to the codebase. Thus, I might consider using Git if I need to collaborate on a project. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example. 

Answer: Data science could be applied to the medical field. Specifically, it could be used to analyze patient data to identify risk factors,
predict disease progression, and recommend personalized treatments.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing? 

Answer: Merging combines two branches by tying them together while still preserving the history. Rebasing, on the other hand, reapplies branch 
commits on top of another branch, effectively rewriting the branch history in order to combine the results. 

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester? 

Answer: I'm looking forward to learning more about data science with CMSC320! I've always wanted to explore the field, but have only done some 
rudimentary work within it. Thus, I'm really excited to dive deeper into it this semester.
